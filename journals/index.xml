      <description>Today I was able to deploy my hugo theme based website. So, after lots of errors and efforts, finally I was able to do this.
Today Real Madrid won in UCL by beating PSG. What a player Benzema is. Then I was working on my CV project. So that wraps up my main activities of the day!.
Guten tag!</description>

      <description>This is my first day of journal writing. The main reason for writing these journals is because i want to increase my language skills in english. Also I want my website to be more active and I want to increase my typing speed.
Today the day got started with my computer vision tasks at the office. Today was a good day!.</description>

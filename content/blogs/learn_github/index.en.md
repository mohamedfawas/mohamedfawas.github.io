I have been using github for more than 2 years now. Eventhough I have created my github account when I was doing my bachelors, I started using it only after I started doing my masters in CS. 

Here I will post some of the usefull resources from which you can learn about GIT and GITHUB.

- To learn the basics, use Kunal Kushwaha's [GIT and GITHUB lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apGV9Kg7ics)

It is very important to know how to manage the GITHUB repositories using the VS Code editor.
To learn this use the [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6YeMhvp2S7abEHqkUPRkCSt4N2wpTwD) created by the official VS code channel in youtube.

I am Mohamed Fawas from India. I am a backend developer. This is my updated [resume]().

I regularly publish blogs on my [hashnode profile]() about my journey in open source. Most of my blogs  are related to backend development, go-lang and open source projects.

I tweet about my learning in public journey at my [twitter profile](). If anyone wants to discuss and collaborate on open source projects, please do message me on twitter. Also, you can contact me through gmail : [fawastmh@gmail.com]().

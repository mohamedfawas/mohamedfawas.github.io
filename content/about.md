Iâ€™m Mohamed Fawas, a dedicated backend developer with a focus on building scalable and efficient systems using Go (Golang). With strong expertise in Microservices Architecture, gRPC, RESTful APIs, and Kubernetes, I have the technical skills necessary to create robust backend solutions. This is my updated [resume]().

I am experienced in working with databases such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB, as well as leveraging modern tools like Docker and CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment and development processes. My proficiency extends to concurrent programming, error handling, and comprehensive testing methodologies, ensuring reliability and performance across projects.

With 1 year of hands-on experience in Golang, I am currently expanding my knowledge by exploring projects related to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) ecosystem.

I frequently publish blogs on my [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@mohamedfawas) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/mohamedfawas1) profiles, sharing insights from my journey in open-source development. My content primarily focuses on backend development, Go (Golang), and contributions to various open-source projects.

I also document my learning and growth in public via Twitter, where I actively engage with the developer community. If you're interested in discussing or collaborating on open-source projects, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MOHAMEDFAWAS182) or connect with me via [email](mailto:fawastmh@gmail.com).

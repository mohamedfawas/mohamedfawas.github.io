# How to prepare for MSc data science/ data analytics entrance exams


Nowadays there are many colleges providing data science courses. But to get admission to prestigious  institutes you need to clear their entrance exam with a good rank. I myself was able to successfully clear the entrance test of IIITM-k (currently known as Digital University of Kerala). So, here I will explain  all resources you can use to successfully clear the MSc data analytics/ data science entrance exams of DUK and CUSAT. Most of the colleges out there are using similar syllabus for their entrance also. So, this might be useful for other entrance exams too. 

# Syllabus of DUK entrance and CUSAT entrance

In this **[link](https://duk.ac.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Digital-University-Aptitude-Test-DUAT-2022-Syllabus.pdf)** you can see the entrance syllabus for this year(2022-23).

As you can see the entrance exams for MSc Data Analytics and MSc Computer Science are different. Also, you can see that DUK provides an MSc Computer Science course with a specialization in Data Analytics and . So as a data analytics aspirant, this will make you a little confused about which entrance you should apply to. 
Anyway, I will explain my thoughts on choosing between those two entrances in another post. 

In this **[link](https://admissions.cusat.ac.in/pros_2020)** on the 52nd page (*Test code: 502*) you can see the entrance syllabus for the MSc computer science course ( which is the gateway for admission to data science and artificial intelligence specializations ) in CUSAT this year(2022-23).

#### General topics for data analytics/ data science entrances of CUSAT and DUK 

###### General Aptitude
**Quantitative Aptitude**

In this section to solve problems more than understanding the concepts, you should know some shortcuts. For this, I had used tutorial videos provided in this **[youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpyc33gOcbVA4qXMoQ5vmhefTruk5t9lt)**. Understanding the concepts and practicing along with watching the video will help you a lot for the entrance exam. 

**Verbal Aptitude**

The syllabus mentioned here is similar to the syllabus used by Wipro for the WLTH selection test. So, to prepare for this section you can follow tutorials in this **[youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8EHEKsT4Gn6MubILtWDl_pwx_6dcIWbq)**. 

**Analytical Aptitude**

To solve this type of question you should get trained in using some shortcut tricks. For this, you can follow tutorials in this **[youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpyc33gOcbVADMKqylI__O_O_RMeHTyNK)** and get a good level of practice.

**Spatial Aptitude**

To get trained in this section you can just follow this **[youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KIguWBm7Ro)**

###### Mathematics

Some of the topics (Probability, chain rule, etc.) mentioned here are also part of the youtube playlist I mentioned in the *Quantitative Aptitude* section. 
For other topics, you can practice questions from the below-mentioned website links.
* **[Statistics](https://www.javatpoint.com/statistics-mcq)**
* **[Discrete Mathematics](https://www.javatpoint.com/discrete-mathematics-mcq)**
* **[Basic number theory](https://engineeringinterviewquestions.com/mcqs-on-number-theory-prime-numbers-answers/)**
* **[Algebra ](https://www.examsbook.com/algebra-questions-and-answers-for-competitive-exams)**

###### English Reading comprehension

For this section, I don't have any recommendations. This measures your level of knowledge of English language. This can be gained only through years of practice. 

#### Computer science related topics  

When I was attending IIITM-k entrance I was a total beginner in this section( Since I don't have a background in computer science). So, I was really confused about my preparation for this section. But after going through some of the previous year's question papers I found they are just checking whether we know the very basic things in computer science. But within the limited time before me, I was sure that watching any lectures won't help me here. 

So what I did was, practice more no: of MCQ questions in this topic and just get familiar with some of the general questions in this topic. This approach worked really well and many of the questions in the actual entrance were easy for me.

So I will give links to some of the MCQs in the respective topics
* [Data Structure](https://www.javatpoint.com/data-structure-mcq)
* [Stack & Queue](https://www.gkseries.com/computer-engineering/data-structure/multiple-choice-questions-and-answers-6)
* [Introduction to computer networks](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-network-mcq)
* [Database Management Systems ](https://www.javatpoint.com/dbms-mcq)
* [Overview of Operating Systems](https://www.javatpoint.com/operating-system-mcq)
* [Hardware concepts related to OS, CPU states, I/O channels,](https://www.interviewbit.com/operating-system-mcq/)
* [Algorithm analysis](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/algorithms-gq/analysis-of-algorithms-gq/) . For this topic you may need to follow any youtube tutorial video to get a basic understanding of the topic. I would recommend not to spend much time on this topic if you find this tougher (As a beginner in CS, you may find this a bit tougher).
* [Computer Fundamental](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-fundamental-mcq)
* [Computer Architecture](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-architecture-mcq)
* [Computer Network](https://www.javatpoint.com/computer-network-mcq)
* [Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/operating-system-mcq)
* [Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://www.interviewbit.com/daa-mcq/)
* [Introduction to Programming ](https://t4tutorials.com/mcqs-of-introduction-to-programming/)
* [Cyber Security](https://www.javatpoint.com/cyber-security-mcq)
* [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.javatpoint.com/artificial-intelligence-mcq)

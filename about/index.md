# About me

>“Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” - **Ferris Bueller**

I am Mohamed Fawas. I am from Malappuram, Kerala. 

During my school days up to 10th, I was more of an introvert and I was much into cricket and watching football. I stopped playing football after a horrible injury. Then I got selected to the BHABHA school batch, this was a turning point in my life, where I met a lot of new people and explored a much more extroverted character of myself.

Even though I liked the IT field, I thought in the management field I can build a better career for myself. With this in my mind, I was looking forward to joining any 3-year course like BSc, So that I can start my MBA as soon as possible. So, I joined Farook college for BSc Statistics. Initially, I wanted to switch my course to physics or chemistry. But after listening to some lectures about the ‘career opportunities in statistics field’ by my beloved teacher Fazil sir, I made my decision I am going to stay at statistics itself. 

Even though initially (1st year at Farook ) I never liked Farook, the last two years at Farook were awesome. More than being active in the college, I was much more active in the Statistics department. Teachers in the statistics department are very much supportive and friendly. The 3 years in Farook college shaped my thinking and helped me to explore more in life. But I was feeling like I am missing something in my life. After the final year, I started applying for my PG for different colleges. I was really confused to choose between a master's in statistics, computer science, and MBA.

Then comes the coronavirus pandemic days. So, during these days I was really worried about what will happen in my career next. Every entrance exam I had applied for was getting rescheduled and that made me confused about which entrance I should focus on. Then IIITM-k organized a remote entrance exam and I got selected in that. 

Then I took the admission for data analytics specialization at IIITM-k. At IIITM-k, I was meeting new people, learning new things, and exploring a lot. These days in IIITM-k shaped my thinking and made me who I am today and I wouldn’t change a thing. These days helped me to get out of my comfort zone. Even though life at IIITM-k was hectic and competitive, I was able to get connected to a lot of interesting people. All of them are very close to my heart and I really enjoyed every moment at IIITM-k.

So, currently, I am in the final semester of my MSc. But now I am away from my college and working from home. I really miss my people at IIITM-k.

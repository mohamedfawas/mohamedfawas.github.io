But to get admission to prestigious institutes you need to clear their entrance exam with a good rank. I myself was able to successfully clear the entrance test of IIITM-k (currently known as Digital University of Kerala). So, here I will explain some of the resources you can use to successfully clear the MSc data analytics/ data science entrance exams of DUK and CUSAT. Most of the colleges out there are using similar syllabus for their entrance also. So, this might be useful for other entrance exams too. Syllabus of DUK entrance and CUSAT entrance In this link you can see the entrance syllabus for this year(2022-23). As you can see the entrance exams for MSc Data Analytics and MSc Computer Science are different. Also, you can see that DUK provides an MSc Computer Science course with a specialization in Data Analytics . So as a data analytics aspirant, this will make you a little confused about which entrance you should apply to. Anyway, I will explain my thoughts on choosing between those two entrances in another post. In this link on the 52nd page (Test code: 502) you can see the entrance syllabus for the MSc computer science course ( which is the gateway for admission to data science and artificial intelligence specializations ) in CUSAT this year(2022-23). General topics for data analytics/ data science entrances of CUSAT and DUK General Aptitude Quantitative Aptitude In this section to solve problems more than understanding the concepts, you should know some shortcuts. For this, I had used tutorial videos provided in this youtube playlist. Understanding the concepts and practicing along with watching the video will help you a lot for the entrance exam. Verbal Aptitude The syllabus mentioned here is similar to the syllabus used by Wipro for the WLTH selection test. So, to prepare for this section you can follow tutorials in this youtube playlist. Analytical Aptitude To solve this type of question you should get trained in using some shortcut tricks. For this, you can follow tutorials in this youtube playlist and get a good level of practice. Spatial Aptitude To get trained in this section you can just follow this youtube video Mathematics Some of the topics (Probability, chain rule, etc.) mentioned here are also part of the youtube playlist I mentioned in the Quantitative Aptitude section. For other topics, you can practice questions from the below-mentioned website links. Statistics Discrete Mathematics Basic number theory Algebra English Reading comprehension For this section, I don’t have any recommendations. This measures your level of knowledge of English language. This can be gained only through years of practice. Computer science related topics When I was attending IIITM-k entrance I was a total beginner in this section( Since I don’t have a background in computer science). So, I was really confused about my preparation for this section. But after going through some of the previous year’s question papers I found they are just checking whether we know the very basic things in computer science. But within the limited time before me, I was sure that watching any lectures won’t help me here. So what I did was, practice more no: of MCQ questions in this topic and just get familiar with some of the general questions in this topic. This approach worked really well and many of the questions in the actual entrance were easy for me. So I will give links to some of the MCQs in the respective topics Data Structure Stack \u0026 Queue Introduction to computer networks Database Management Systems Overview of Operating Systems Hardware concepts related to OS, CPU states, I/O channels, Algorithm analysis . For this topic you may need to follow any youtube tutorial video to get a basic understanding of the topic. I would recommend not to spend much time on this topic if you find this tougher (As a beginner in CS, you may find this a bit tougher).

Here I will describe some of the freely available content in online which I myself had used and found good. So I will divide this learning plan into two levels. ie, level A and B. Level A As a complete beginner, you should learn two things to improve your basics. Basic statistics used in data science A programming language used in the data science domain Learning statistics For learning statistics concepts I would recommend the youtube playlist provided by Josh Starmer. Go through each concept and make notes on them for easy revisions. Learning python You should learn a programming language that is widely used in the field of data science. For this, we can choose one from R, Python, or Julia. Personally, I would recommend you to learn python because more projects in the data science field are done using python and as a result, more jobs are available for people who are trained in python. Survey of Kagglers finds Python, R to be preferred tools For learning Python from scratch, you can go through this youtube playlist provided by Telusko. I would like to tell you about a mistake that I have committed while I was learning python (which was the first general-purpose programming language I was learning in my life). I used to watch these 100+ videos without practicing/solving more real-world problems using python. But later I came to know this method is not at all productive. So, I would recommend you to practice more problems using python along with following these youtube tutorials. For practicing python problems you can use hackerrank. There are other platforms for coding practice like codestudio and exercism. My personal favourite is hackerrank in this scenerio. You should try to solve these problems yourself. If you are not able to solve the problems in hackerrank and want solutions for those problems you can check this github repository. But check this only after trying to solve the problems yourself for sometimes. Level B So now you must have learned very basic things that a data scientist should learn. Now you should concentrate on doing these two things simultaneously Learn basics of machine learning Solve data science problems using python notebook Basics of machine learning After reaching this level, you can start learning basic machine learning algorithms from this youtube playlist provided by Josh Starmer. After covering that tutorial playlist, you can proceed to lean deep learning. For this, you can use this youtube playlist provided by Grant Sanderson. Python notebooks At this level, you can start practicing some basic ML algorithms in a python notebook. This can be done by practicing on this practice task provided by machinehack. After doing these things you can try completing all other practice tasks provided by machinehack. Projects, projects, projects … Now you can start working on more real-world data science projects. Having more projects in your resume will attract more potential employers. For this, you can try being part of competitions in kaggle. Based on your participation and performance in these kaggle competitions, you will get points and an overall ranking in kaggle. You can use this kaggle rank to attract potential employers and you can show these kaggle projects you have done when you are applying for internships/jobs.

If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” - Ferris Bueller I am Mohamed Fawas. I am from Malappuram, Kerala. During my school days up to 10th, I was more of an introvert and I was much into cricket and watching football. I stopped playing football after a horrible injury. Then I got selected to the BHABHA school batch, this was a turning point in my life, where I met a lot of new people and explored a much more extroverted character of myself. BHABHA batch tour Even though I liked the IT field, I thought in the management field I can build a better career for myself. With this in my mind, I was looking forward to joining any 3-year course like BSc, So that I can start my MBA as soon as possible. So, I joined Farook college for BSc Statistics. Initially, I wanted to switch my course to physics or chemistry. But after listening to some lectures about the ‘career opportunities in statistics field’ by my beloved teacher Fazil sir, I made my decision I am going to stay at statistics itself. Even though initially (1st year at Farook ) I never liked Farook, the last two years at Farook were awesome. More than being active in the college, I was much more active in the Statistics department. Teachers in the statistics department are very much supportive and friendly. The 3 years in Farook college shaped my thinking and helped me to explore more in life. But I was feeling like I am missing something in my life. After the final year, I started applying for my PG for different colleges. I was really confused to choose between a master’s in statistics, computer science, and MBA. Days at FC❤️-Fozlava 2k19 Then comes the coronavirus pandemic days. So, during these days I was really worried about what will happen in my career next. Every entrance exam I had applied for was getting rescheduled and that made me confused about which entrance I should focus on. Then IIITM-k organized a remote entrance exam and I got selected in that. Then I took the admission for data analytics specialization at IIITM-k. At IIITM-k, I was meeting new people, learning new things, and exploring a lot. These days in IIITM-k shaped my thinking and made me who I am today and I wouldn’t change a thing. These days helped me to get out of my comfort zone. Even though life at IIITM-k was hectic and competitive, I was able to get connected to a lot of interesting people. All of them are very close to my heart and I really enjoyed every moment at II","date":"2019-08-02","objectID":"/about/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"About Mohamed Fawas","uri":"/about/"}]

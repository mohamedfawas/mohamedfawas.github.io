If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” - Ferris Bueller I am Mohamed Fawas. I am from Malappuram, Kerala. During my school days upto 10th I was more of an introvert and I was much into cricket and watching football. I stopped playing football after a horrible injury. Then I got selected to BHABHA school batch, this was a turning point in my life, where I met a lot of new people and explored much more extrovert character of myself. BHABHA batch tour Even though I liked IT field, I thought in a management field I can build a better career for me. With this in my mind, I was looking forward to join for any 3 year course like BSc, So that I can start my MBA as soon as possible. So, I joined Farook college for BSc Statistics. Initially I wanted to switch my course to physics or chemistry. But after listening to some lectures about the ‘career opportunities in statistics field’ by my beloved teacher Fazil sir, I made my decision I am going to stay at statistics itself. Even though initially (1st year at Farook ) I never liked Farook, the last two years at Farook was awesome. More than being active in the college, I was much more active in the Statistics department. Teachers at statistics department is very much supportive and friendly. The 3 years in Farook college shaped my thinking and helped me to explore more in life. But I was feeling like I am missing something in my life. After the final year I started applying for my PG for different colleges. I was really confused to choose between a masters in statistics, computer science and MBA. Days at FC❤️-Fozlava 2k19 Then comes the corona virus pandemic days. So, during these days I was really worried about what will happen in my career next. Every entrance exams I had applied were getting rescheduled and that made me confused about on which entrance I should focus. Then IIITM-k organised remote entrance exam and I got selected in that. Then I took admission for data analytics specialization at IIITM-k. At IIITM-k, I was meeting new people, learning new things and exploring a lot. These days in IIITM-k shaped my thinking and made me who I am today and I wouldn’t change a thing. These days helped me to get out of my comfort zone. Even though life at IIITM-k was hectic and competitive, I was able to get connected to a lot of interesting people. All of them are very close to my heart and I really enjoyed every moment at IIITM-k. Moments at IIITM-k So, currently I am in the final semester of my MSc.
